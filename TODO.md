# To-Do List: Athena Multilingual Research Ingestion Module

## 1. Pre-Implementation & Planning

- [x] Define overall system architecture (frontend, backend, storage, security layers)
- [x] Identify and specify all supported file formats and languages
- [x] Select translation API/service (ensure DoD compliance)
- [x] Choose document parsing and NLP libraries
- [x] Specify metadata schema (fields, data types, format)
- [x] Draft initial UI/UX wireframes for upload and review flows
- [x] Outline cybersecurity requirements (malware scanning, sandboxing, RBAC)
- [x] Set up version control and project management tools

## 2. Frontend Development (JavaScript)

- [x] **Build Upload Dashboard**
  - Drag-and-drop and file selector components
  - Batch file upload support
  - Display upload progress and status indicators

- [x] **User Feedback & Error Handling**
  - Real-time feedback for upload, processing, translation, and extraction steps
  - Clear error messages for failed uploads or extractions

- [ ] **Metadata Review & Correction**
  - Preview extracted metadata and translated abstract
  - Editable fields for manual correction before submission

- [ ] **Accessibility & Usability**
  - Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
  - Responsive design for different devices

## 3. Backend Development (Python)

- [x] **File Ingestion & Storage**
  - API endpoint for file uploads
  - Validate file types and sizes
  - Store original files securely

- [x] **Malware Scanning & Sandboxing**
  - Integrate antivirus scanning (e.g., ClamAV)
  - Process files in isolated environment

- [ ] **Language Detection & Translation**
  - Detect document language automatically
  - Route non-English documents through translation service
  - Handle translation errors and notify frontend

- [ ] **Document Parsing**
  - Extract raw text from PDFs, DOCX, TXT, LaTeX, HTML, XML
  - Normalize text for downstream processing

- [ ] **Metadata Extraction**
  - Use NLP to extract title, authors, abstract, keywords, publication date
  - Fallback to template matching if NLP fails

- [ ] **Metadata File Generation**
  - Create standardized JSON/XML metadata files
  - Link metadata to ingested documents

- [ ] **Queue Management & Scalability**
  - Implement asynchronous processing (Celery, RabbitMQ)
  - Monitor and optimize pipeline performance

## 4. Security & Data Hygiene

- [ ] **Access Controls**
  - Enforce authentication and RBAC for all ingestion endpoints

- [ ] **Audit Logging**
  - Log all upload, processing, and user correction actions

- [ ] **Data Encryption**
  - Encrypt files at rest and in transit

- [ ] **Vulnerability Management**
  - Set up dependency monitoring and regular patching

## 5. Integration & Testing

- [ ] **Unit and Integration Tests**
  - Test file uploads, parsing, translation, and metadata extraction
  - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms

- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing**
  - Simulate end-to-end ingestion with various file types and languages
  - Collect feedback on UI and metadata accuracy

- [ ] **Security Testing**
  - Penetration testing for upload endpoints
  - Test malware scanning and sandbox escape prevention

## 6. Deployment & Monitoring

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Automate build, test, and deployment steps

- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerts**
  - Set up monitoring for ingestion pipeline health and security events

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Write developer and user documentation
  - Document API endpoints and metadata schema

## 7. Post-Launch & Iteration

- [ ] **Collect User Feedback**
  - In-app feedback mechanism for ingestion experience

- [ ] **Iterate on Features**
  - Improve NLP and translation accuracy
  - Add support for new file formats or languages as needed

- [ ] **Ongoing Security Reviews**
  - Schedule regular security audits and updates
